## Project Description

This was a project I created on my own that is essentially a fantasy football application. The project has full authentication provided by JWT and bcrypt and allows the user to create new accounts and view existing accounts. The functionality of the application allows the user to create a team consisting of 11 Premier league players and save that team to their account. They can get a brief overview of the teams stats and also players individual statistics, the homepage also offers statistics of the league currently including league table, top scorers and upcoming fixtures in the premier league.

I used the Football API to gather the data for the players and saved them into my own database

### Installation

This app is hosted on heroku at this link here : https://fantasy-app-corey.herokuapp.com/

This is a create react app alongside and express server and so if you wanted to host it locally you would need to use the npm run dev in the root file which will use the package concurrently to run both environments at the same time.

You would also need to create a .env file in both the client file and the root file with the corresponding example keys in the .env example file

### Usage

Use of this application is straightforward as you can create an account on the site and create a fantasy football team

### Technologies Used

Json Web Token, Bcrypt, React, Sass, Concurrently, Javascript, Node.js, NPM, NPM
